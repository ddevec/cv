\section{Research \\Area}
Software system errors and misbehaviors present a major problem in
writing, maintaining, and using significant software bases.  Security
vulnerabilities can lead to catastrophic data and privacy losses and
great fiscal cost.  Software downtime due to bugs is highly costly for
companies, even when software doesn't crash the cost of developer
effort to eliminate bugs is far too high.  My research seeks to
greatly reduce the burden of software errors.  In an ideal world, once
an individual learns of some mis-behavior, such as a security
vulnerability, information leak, mis-configuration, erroneous data, or
unexpected crash; he or she should have tools which quickly identify
and understand the origin of the error, what state it has affected,
and the system should either identify a solution to the problem, or
self correct.

\section{Research Projects}
\textbf{Optimistic Hybrid Analysis} -- A novel method of dramatically
accelerating dynamic analysis, which combines speculation, a novel
static analysis called predicated static analysis, and speculative
dynamic analysis to ultimately produce a dynamic analysis which is far
more efficient than a traditional dynamic analysis, but just as
accurate.

\textbf{Eidetic Systems} -- A computer operating system which uses
novel deterministic record/replay technology to by default remember
and enable powerful lineage queries for all computation (process
memory states, and inter-process communication).

%\item
\textbf{Parallel Analysis} -- I've used record/replay technology and
epoch parallelism to efficiently parallelize traditionally
heavy-weight difficult to parallelize analyses.  Methods show
super-linear scaling for race-detection, and can scale taint tracking
to 100's of CPU cores.

%  I've worked on parallelizing
%  \emph{Data Race Detection} and \emph{Dynamic Information Flow
%  Tracking}.
%\end{itemize}

%Broadly, my research focus is on Operating Systems.  More specifically
%my research focuses on improving the reliability of programs through
%system-level abstractions.  My most recent work is about ``Eidetic
%Systems," or systems which store their entire computation history.
%``Eidetic Systems" can analyze any computation done on them, to
%understand how past computations have effected current states.

\section{Non-Research \\ Projects}
\textbf{TalkingBook} -- A computer system catered to the challenges of
the developing world, specifically targeting extremely low-cost and
power consumption.  We have developed a custom microprocessor with
novel memory architecture and operating system designed to be
accessible to the world's poorest people.  A joint work between the
University of Michigan and Literacy Bridge
(http://literacybridge.org).
