\section{Research \\Area}
Today computers by default discard their rich history of prior computation and
memory states.  My vision is to create computer systems with the default of
remembering all past computation and furthermore making it practical to query
the massive, rich database of computation recorded.  My research focuses on
creating system-level abstractions and developing novel analysis methodologies
to accomplish this goal.  

\section{Research Projects}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item 
\textbf{Optimistic Hybrid Analysis} -- A novel analysis methodology
which combines speculation, static analysis, and dynamic analysis to
ultimately produce a dynamic analysis which is far more efficient than
a traditional dynamic analysis, but just as accurate (under
submission).

%\item
\textbf{Eidetic Systems} -- A computer operating system which by
default remembers and can query all computation (process memory states, and
inter-process communication) done on it.

%\item
\textbf{Parallel Analysis} -- I've worked on parallelizing
\textbf{Data Race Detection} and \textbf{Dynamic Information Flow
Tracking}.
%\end{itemize}

%Broadly, my research focus is on Operating Systems.  More specifically
%my research focuses on improving the reliability of programs through
%system-level abstractions.  My most recent work is about ``Eidetic
%Systems," or systems which store their entire computation history.
%``Eidetic Systems" can analyze any computation done on them, to
%understand how past computations have effected current states.

\section{Non-Research \\ Projects}
\textbf{TalkingBook} --
A computer system catered to the challenges of the developing world,
specifically targeting extremely low-cost and power consumption.  We
created a custom microprocessor with novel memory architecture and
operating system designed to be accessible to the world's
poorest people.  A joint work between the University of Michigan and
Literacy Bridge (http://literacybridge.org).
